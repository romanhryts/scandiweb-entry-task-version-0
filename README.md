My name is Roman and I'm Trainee Front-end Developer from Ukraine. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

This is my first edition of the entry task in Scandiweb IT company. 

Here I used a very simple tech-stack that includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies without any frameworks and/or libraries.

The second edition of this task with using React.js frameworks and also GraphQL will be able as soon as possible.
